            <h3>Key Benefits of Personal Umbrella Insurance:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-4 mb-3">
                <li>Extended Coverage Beyond Limits: If your home, auto, or boat insurance policy’s limits
                    are
                    exceeded by a claim, your personal umbrella policy steps in, offering additional
                    coverage.
                    Whether it's a lawsuit, an accident, or a claim for damages, the umbrella policy
                    provides an
                    extra cushion.</li>
                <li>Protection Against Large Lawsuits: Personal Umbrella Insurance helps cover legal fees,
                    settlements, or judgments resulting from serious accidents or lawsuits that might
                    otherwise
                    threaten your financial future.</li>
                <li>Coverage for Multiple Areas: Beyond car accidents or home-related claims, personal
                    umbrella
                    insurance can extend to a range of situations, including personal injury, slander, or
                    even
                    certain damages to rented properties.</li>
                <li>Affordable Peace of Mind: Despite offering high coverage limits, umbrella policies are
                    often
                    quite affordable. For a relatively small increase in premium, you get significant
                    additional
                    protection, especially for risks that your regular policies may not cover.</li>
                <li>Protection for Your Future Earnings: If you're sued and the claim exceeds your primary
                    insurance
                    limits, an umbrella policy can protect your assets and income from garnishment, securing
                    your
                    financial future.</li>
