            <h2>Johnson Insurance Group Named a Commercial Lines ‘Circle of Excellence Agency’ by Umialik Insurance Company and
                Western National Insurance Group
            </h2>
            <p>(Anchorage, Alaska) Umialik Insurance Company today announced that Soldotna, Alaska-based <span
                    class="font-bold">Johnson Insurance Group</span>
                has been named one of Umialik’s Commercial Lines Circle of Excellence Agencies for 2024.</p>
            <p>
                The <span class="italic">Umialik Commercial Lines Circle of Excellence</span> recognition is announced annually
                to spotlight an elite group
                of partners who have excelled based on performance and growth over the past five years (2019 - 2023). An agency
                must also demonstrate that they meet high standards of professional excellence and integrity in order to be
                considered for this recognition. Johnson Insurance Group’s place among this list is a testament to the overall
                quality of the agency’s insurance professionals and their commitment to meeting the needs of their insurance
                clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                This recognition places Johnson Insurance Group in the 85th percentile of all Umialik and Western National
                Insurance Group commercial lines partners for overall performance, growth, and partnership over the past five
                years.
